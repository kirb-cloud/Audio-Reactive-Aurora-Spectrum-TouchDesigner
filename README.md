# Audio-Reactive-Aurora-Spectrum-TouchDesigner
This TouchDesigner project is an audio-reactive aurora spectrum visual that transforms live sound into immersive, flowing light patterns reminiscent of the northern lights. The visual system uses a combination of Noise, Spectrum, and CHOP-based audio analysis to generate smooth, wave-like movements that pulse in real time with the music.
